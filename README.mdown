#ArticleFinder

ArticleFinder is a NodeJS module for parsing articles from webpages to extract the main content:

*  Title
*  Article Content (HTML!)
*  Author
*  Images (those that are not on the post content)

##Install
    npm install articlefinder

##Usage

It's quite easy to use ArticleFinder:

    var articlefinder = require('articlefinder');
	var url = "http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/18/beyond-facebook-the-rise-of-interest-based-social-networks/";
	articlefinder.getArticle(url, function (article) {
		console.log(article.title);
	});
	
The `getArticle(url, callback)` method returns in the callback a article object, which contains:

    article = {"title":"title of the article", "content":"the html content of the page", "images":"the images outside the 
				body of article", "author":"the person who wrote the article"};
